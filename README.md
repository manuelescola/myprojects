# 📂 Project Repository Update  

This repository previously contained all my projects, but they are now organized into **individual repositories** for better structure and clarity.  

## 🔗 Where to Find My Projects  
You can explore all my work directly on my **GitHub profile**:  
👉 [**Manuel Escola's GitHub**](https://github.com/manuelescola)  

There, you will find repositories covering:  
- 🤖 **Generative AI** projects  
- 📊 **Finance and quantitative analysis**  
- 🎮 **A/B testing for video games**  
- 📚 **NLP, deep learning, and machine learning**  
- 🏗️ **Other personal and academic projects**  

Thank you for visiting! Feel free to check out my work and connect. 🚀
